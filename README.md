# Magic Utils

[![Build and Release .deb](https://github.com/dcoppari/magic-utils/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dcoppari/magic-utils/actions/workflows/build.yml)

**Magic Utils** is a lightweight set of tools for converting PCL to PDF, generating printable QR codes, and remotely spooling documents. It's built for legacy environments, and automated printing workflows.

Included tools:

- `magicpcl`: converts PCL to PDF, applies background overlays, sends to printer or spools.
- `magicqr`: generates a QR code and outputs a PCL-ready file.
- `magicspool`: sends a Base64-encoded PDF over TCP to a remote spool server.
- `pcl6`: bundled binary to convert PCL to PDF.
- `fonts` font files for standalone usage (required by pcl6).
